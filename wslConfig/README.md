# Software Installation



## Disclaimer

## Run program installation

Clone the project if it is not cloned already:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:DuarteArribas/w11-config.git
```

Alternatively, download the zip and unzip it.

Go to the project directory:

```bash
cd wslConfig
```

Change the name and email in `.gitconfig`.

Run `inconfig.sh`:

```bash
bash inconfig.sh 
```

This will install some default packages and add default configurations for git and bash.
